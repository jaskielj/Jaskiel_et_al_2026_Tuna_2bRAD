Abstract from the Publication:
Understanding how dispersal, life history, and environmental variability shape genetic connectivity in the open ocean remains a central challenge in evolutionary biology. Highly migratory marine predators like tunas have traditionally been considered genetically homogeneous across ocean basins, yet emerging genomic evidence suggests that cryptic population structure can persist even in species with high gene flow and large effective population sizes. We used 2bRAD sequencing of 360 larval and subadult skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), and bigeye tuna (T. obesus) collected from the central Pacific to examine species boundaries, demographic histories, and population structure. Larval sampling revealed consistent spawning habitat use by all three species and enabled unbiased detection of genetic patterns prior to recruitment bottlenecks. Demographic reconstructions indicate historical expansions coinciding with warm interglacial periods, linking paleoclimate cycles in the Pacific to population size changes in pelagic predators. We found strong divergence among species, no evidence of intraspecific structuring in skipjack or bigeye, and a previously undocumented yellowfin subpopulation repeatedly detected near American Samoa. These results highlight how larval genomics can reveal fine-scale structure and historical demographic signatures in highly vagile species, providing new perspectives on connectivity, adaptation, and evolution in the open ocean.
